# Inverse Design of Cooling Channels Using Neural Networks

A machine learning-driven approach for the inverse design of internal cooling channel geometries based on thermal load distribution. This project combines deep learning, computational physics, and 3D visualization to generate optimized thermal layouts — a unique fusion of AI and engineering design.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to **generate optimal cooling channel designs** given a target thermal load distribution. Traditional cooling systems use iterative CFD-based optimization — this approach **learns the design space** from simulated data and provides **fast, intelligent, geometry suggestions**.

## Theoretical Background

This project explores the inverse design of cooling channels using neural networks, grounded in classical heat transfer theory and numerical simulation.

### 1. Heat Diffusion Equation (Steady-State)

The simulation is based on the 2D steady-state heat conduction equation:
- -∇ · (k ∇T) = Q


Where:
- `T` = Temperature distribution (what we want to solve for)
- `k` = Thermal conductivity of the material
- `Q` = Internal heat generation (often zero)
- `∇ ·` = Divergence operator

This partial differential equation models how heat spreads spatially through a solid.

---

### 2. Boundary Conditions

To make the simulation realistic, boundary conditions are applied:
- **Dirichlet (Fixed Temperature):** used to simulate hot or cold surfaces
- **Neumann (Heat Flux / Insulated):** used to model insulation or controlled heating/cooling zones

These conditions define the heat source and sink areas that form the **input thermal maps** for the neural network.

---

### 3. Cooling Channel Optimization

The objective of this project is to create **internal cooling geometries** that:
- Minimize peak temperatures
- Maintain a uniform thermal field
- Use minimal channel area (i.e., efficient design)

Traditionally, this is a **topology optimization problem** solved using computationally expensive FEM loops. In this project, it is approximated using a deep learning model.

---

### 4. Inverse Problem Framing

The problem is framed as an **inverse design task**:
- Forward Problem: Geometry → Temperature Field
- Inverse Problem: Temperature Field → Geometry

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is trained to learn this inverse mapping — predicting cooling channel geometry directly from the input heat map.

---

### 5. Dataset Generation Using FEniCS

The dataset is generated using thermal simulations:

- Various cooling geometries are modeled
- Their resulting temperature fields are simulated using FEniCS (FEM)
- Each training pair consists of:
   - Input → Thermal map T(x, y)
   - Output → Geometry mask G(x, y)

These are used for supervised learning of the CNN.

---

###  6. Model Loss Function

The CNN is trained using a custom loss function:
- Loss = α * MSE(G_pred, G_true) + β * ThermalPenalty

Where:
- `G_pred` = predicted geometry mask
- `G_true` = ground truth optimal geometry
- `ThermalPenalty` = optional penalty based on simulation performance
- `α`, `β` = hyperparameters to control the balance

This helps the model optimize both **structural accuracy** and **thermal effectiveness**.

##  How It Works

1. **Thermal Simulation**:
   - Generate synthetic thermal load maps using FEniCS by simulating 2D heat diffusion.
   - Define "good" cooling geometries via temperature minimization goals.

2. **Dataset Generation**:
   - Pairs of `input: heatmap` → `output: optimal geometry` created.
   - Encoded as binary masks or pixel-wise channel designs.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Trained a CNN to learn this mapping using PyTorch.
   - Loss = design fidelity + temperature deviation penalties.

4. **Geometry Visualization**:
   - Generated outputs rendered in Blender using scripted automation.
   - Preview cooling channels as 3D flow regions inside mechanical parts.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Run simulation on AI-generated geometry to verify cooling effectiveness.
   - Compare against baseline design.
